# RaspberyPi-Car
Coding project to create a car using a raspberry pi5, 2 DC hobby motors, and an Auto pHAT with a motor driver, encoder reader, and 9DOF IMU. The ultimate goal is for the car to be able to take keyboard control inputs to drive a course, and afterwards to double integrate the collected acceleration data to estimate its final position
